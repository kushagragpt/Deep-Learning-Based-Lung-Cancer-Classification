# Deep-Learning-Based-Lung-Cancer-Classification

## Description
This project aims to detect different types of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and normal) using convolutional neural networks (CNN).

## Objective
- Develop a deep learning model to classify lung cancer images with high accuracy.
- Implement various regularization techniques to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting.

## Approach
- Applied L2 regularization, batch normalization, early stopping, and learning rate reduction to optimize model performance.
- Conducted 5-fold cross-validation to validate the model.

## Results
- Achieved an overall accuracy of 95% on the validation set.
- Model was able to distinguish between lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and normal lung tissue effectively.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- cv2 (OpenCV)
